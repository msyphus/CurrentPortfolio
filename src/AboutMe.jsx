                I've been a full stack web developer for over 4 years.  Most of this experience has been developing tools for use in 
                manufacturing facilities.  I've done everything from redesigning the app to improve user experience, optimizing performance of the app, 
                setting up how the app deploys, migrating the app to new servers, communicating with third-party manufacturing equipment, 
                generating automated email notifications, maintaining existing features, and creating new features such as real-time production dashboards, 
                inventory management tools, purchasing requests/ordering systems, project management tools, and production record keeping tools.

                Prior to web development, I gained strong coding skills through 8 years of statistics programming and Microsoft VBA. 
                As a second generation programmer, I got an introduction to coding as a child. After growing up and becoming a 
                world-class scientist, my R programming skills became a powerful asset in my regular work responsibilities. I also 
                learned to use Excel VBA to build sophisticated tools to help with management review, data collection, and 
                automating product quality designation decisions. Throughout my years of management and consulting experience, I kept 
                seeing a common problem across all companies large and small, no matter the industry: Everyone needs software tools to 
                perform their jobs but the software tools frequently create severe problems. An operation can only be as efficient as 
                its software allows it to be. Therefore I now create software with the intent of improving productivity for users, businesses, and developers.
